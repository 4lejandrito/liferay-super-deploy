# Liferay Super Deploy

Deploy all changed modules at once (hopefully).

It is not very well thought but it generally works and I use it almost daily. It might be improved over time.

## Installation

Move the `lsd` script to your $PATH.

## Usage

Just run `lsd` anywhere inside the liferay-portal repo and enjoy. You might have to run it twice if there is interdependence between changed modules.
